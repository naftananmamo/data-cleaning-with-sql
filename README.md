Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and analyze real-world datasets using SQL for data cleaning and Pandas for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Tools & Technologies

SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.

Python (Pandas): EDA, data manipulation, and insights.

Matplotlib: Visualizing trends and patterns in the data.
