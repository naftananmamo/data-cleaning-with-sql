# SQL & Pandas: Data Cleaning & EDA

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates the full workflow of preparing and analyzing data. 
SQL was used to clean and structure raw datasets, while Pandas was employed 
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and uncover insights.

## Technologies & Tools
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and data transformation
- **Python (Pandas):** Data analysis, aggregation, and computation of summary statistics
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of trends and key patterns

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning (SQL):** Standardized column names, removed duplicates, handled missing or inconsistent data
2. **Data Analysis (Pandas):** Explored datasets, computed key metrics, summarized findings
3. **Visualization (Matplotlib):** Created charts to highlight trends and insights

## Key Learnings
- Applying SQL for structured data cleaning
- Leveraging Pandas for thorough exploratory data analysis
- Turning cleaned data into actionable insights
