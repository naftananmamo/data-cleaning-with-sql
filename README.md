SQL & Pandas Project

Project Overview:
This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis. SQL was used to clean and structure the data, and Pandas was used to analyze trends, calculate statistics, and visualize key insights.

Tools & Technologies:

SQL: data cleaning and transformation

Python (Pandas): data analysis and manipulation

Matplotlib: data visualization

Project Workflow:

Cleaned raw data using SQL: removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized columns

Explored data using Pandas: calculated summary statistics, identified trends and patterns

Visualized insights with Matplotlib

Key Learnings:

Efficient data cleaning using SQL

Performing comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas

Converting raw data into actionable insights
